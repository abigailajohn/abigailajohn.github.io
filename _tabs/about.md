## Hello! I'm Abigail ✨
I specialize in Application security where I work with organizations to ensure that security is integrated throughout the software development lifecycle process. I secure APIs, web and mobile apps, containers and cloud platforms. 

Also, I know a thing or more on devsecops and threat modeling. 

## 👩🏽‍💻
I love adventures, learning and taking on challenges. This is my personal blog where I share thoughts, ideas, lessons, and walkthroughs from projects I've worked on or still figuring out. 

## Current adventures 🎯
Lately, I've been exploring AI and also spending a lot of time improving my code review skills and secure development.

## Beyond the code 🌟
I love collaboration, building cool things, and contributing to the community. So if you’ve got an idea you’d like us to work on together — feel free to reach out!

## Let's connect 🫱🏽‍🫲🏽
Outside of work, I’ve written a few articles [on Medium](https://medium.com/@abigailainyang) and co-developed a vulnerable API lab you can check out on [GitHub](https://github.com/abigailajohn/VVMA).

# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my AppSec Docs site!

This space is dedicated o sharing my thoughts, experiences, and resources on application security (Appsec). From in-depth walkthroughs of vulnerable applications and practical guides for building secure applications to learning tips and engineering challenges I've faced, I'm documenting everything that can help security engineers and developers like me.

Whether you're just startung out or want to improve your Appsec skills, I hope these docs will support your jouney in building safer software, learning continuously, and growing in the field.

Let’s make security better together!
